One issue with the way we are implementing finding the substring is that the lifetime of the reference we are giving back needs to be explicitly stated as when we return a reference in a function that reference cannot be a reference to a value created in the function as the scope of that value will end once the function is called so the referenced passed out is useless. Therefore the reference must point to something passed into the function. If we have a function that takes two values, then the Rust compiler can't in all cases tell us which of these values we are referencing and therefore we don't know what the lifetime of the output should be at compile time.
We can't implement a doubly linked list in safe rust because when we create a new node we end up having two nodes try to have a mutable reference two that node. This isn't allowed. Another thing that could be difficult to implement due to this fact is if we had box whose volume is set by two different function both of which want to mutablely reference the volume property of this box.
